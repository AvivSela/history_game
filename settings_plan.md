  - **Contingency**: Provide manual migration tools and support

- **Risk**: Settings validation breaks existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with existing game scenarios
  - **Contingency**: Implement fallback validation with warnings

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Risk**: Phase 1 takes longer than expected
  - **Mitigation**: Start with minimal viable implementation
  - **Contingency**: Extend timeline or reduce scope for later phases

- **Risk**: Testing takes longer than allocated time
  - **Mitigation**: Write tests alongside implementation
  - **Contingency**: Prioritize critical tests and defer others

### **Quality Risks**

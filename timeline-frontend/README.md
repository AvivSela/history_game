## Code Quality & Architecture

### Component Organization

The codebase follows a well-organized component structure with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Components** (`src/components/core/`): Core game logic and UI coordination
- **Game Components** (`src/components/game/`): Game-specific UI elements (Timeline, PlayerHand, AIHand, Card)
- **UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`): Reusable UI components for loading, errors, animations, etc.
- **Layout Components** (`src/components/layout/`): Layout and navigation components (placeholder for future)
- **Constants** (`src/constants/`): Centralized game configuration and constants
- **Types** (`src/types/`): Type definitions and documentation for future TypeScript migration

### Key Improvements

- **Modular Architecture**: Components are focused and single-purpose
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic separated from business logic
- **Maintainability**: Clear component boundaries and consistent naming
- **Testability**: All components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: UI components designed for reuse across the application

### Testing

- **165 comprehensive tests** covering all major functionality
- **Component isolation**: Each component can be tested independently
- **User interaction testing**: Full user flow testing with realistic scenarios
- **Animation testing**: Comprehensive animation and visual feedback testing
- **Standardized test structure**: All tests use `.test.jsx` extension for consistency
- **Organized test files**: Clear separation between component, integration, and utility tests

### Animation System (FE-001)

The Timeline Game now uses a **unified, optimized animation system** for all UI and game animations. This system provides:

- Centralized animation management via `AnimationSystem`
- Device-specific performance optimizations
- Full accessibility support (reduced motion, screen readers)
- Consistent GPU acceleration and optimized CSS keyframes
- Tree-shakable, modular code for smaller bundles

**Key API Usage:**

```js
import { animations, accessibility, performance } from './utils/animation';

// Animate a card shake
await animations.cardShake(element);

// Animate a wrong placement sequence
await animations.wrongPlacement(
  cardElement,
  timelineElement,
  insertionPointElement
);

// Check if animations should run (accessibility)
if (accessibility.shouldAnimate()) {
  // ...
}

// Performance monitoring
performance.logSummary();
```

**Migration Notes:**

- All legacy animation files (`animationUtils.js`, `animationQueue.js`, `contextAwareAnimations.js`, `progressiveAnimations.js`) have been removed.
- All components now use the new API from `src/utils/animation/`.
- See `src/utils/animation/index.js` for the full API surface.

**For more details, see the [FE-001 Animation Performance Optimization Plan](../docs/FE-001-Animation-Performance-Plan.md) and code comments in `AnimationSystem.js`.**

## Testing Guidelines

### Test File Organization

The project follows standardized test file conventions for consistency and maintainability:

#### File Naming Conventions

- **Extension**: All test files use `.test.jsx` extension
- **Naming**: `ComponentName.test.jsx` for components, `featureName.test.jsx` for features
- **Location**: Tests are co-located with their source files

#### Test File Structure

```
src/
├── tests/                           # Integration and feature tests
│   ├── animation.test.jsx          # Animation system tests
│   ├── clickToPlaceFlow.test.jsx   # User interaction flow tests
│   ├── userInteractions.test.jsx   # User interaction tests
│   ├── wrongPlacementAnimation.test.jsx # Wrong placement tests
│   ├── cssAnimations.test.jsx      # CSS animation tests
│   ├── animationQueue.test.jsx     # Animation queue tests
│   ├── setup.js                    # Test setup file
│   └── index.js                    # Test exports
├── utils/                          # Utility functions
│   ├── gameLogic.test.jsx          # Game logic tests
│   └── timelineLogic.test.jsx      # Timeline logic tests
└── components/
    └── game/Timeline/
        └── Timeline.test.jsx       # Component tests
```

#### Test Categories

- **Component Tests**: Test React components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test user flows and component interactions
- **Utility Tests**: Test pure functions and business logic
- **Animation Tests**: Test animation sequences and visual feedback

#### Best Practices

- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Maintain test isolation with proper setup and teardown

### Running Tests

# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test --watch

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test --coverage

# Run specific test file

/**
 * Game State Management Tests
 * 
 * Tests for the useGameState hook covering all major game functionality
 * in a stable, maintainable way that won't break with code changes.
 * 
 * SYSTEM BEHAVIOR DOCUMENTATION:
 * 
 * 1. GAME INITIALIZATION BEHAVIOR:
 *    - Single player mode should initialize with 5 cards in player hand
 *    - Card pool should contain 10 total events (5 in hand + 5 in pool)
 *    - API should be called to fetch random events for the card pool
 *    - Game should start with human player's turn
 *    - Initial state should have no selected card, no feedback, and loading=false
 *    - Scores should start at 0 for both players
 *    - Game status should transition from LOBBY to PLAYING
 *    - If API fails, game should transition to ERROR status with error message
 * 
 * 2. CARD DISTRIBUTION RULES:
 *    - Total cards in game = 10 (POOL_CARD_COUNT constant)
 *    - Player hand = 5 cards (CARD_COUNTS.SINGLE constant)
 *    - Card pool = 5 cards (remaining cards after hand distribution)
 *    - Timeline starts with 0 cards, grows as cards are placed
 *    - All cards must be unique (no duplicates)
 * 
 * 3. GAME FLOW BEHAVIOR:
 *    - Player can select a card from their hand
 *    - Selected card should be highlighted and insertion points shown
 *    - Player can place card at any valid position in timeline
 *    - Correct placement: card moves to timeline, hand decreases by 1
 *    - Incorrect placement: card returns to hand, feedback shown
 *    - Game continues until all cards are correctly placed
 *    - Game ends when hand is empty and all cards are in timeline
 * 
 * 4. ERROR HANDLING EXPECTATIONS:
 *    - API failures should be caught and handled gracefully
 *    - Game should transition to ERROR status on API failure
 *    - Error message should be stored in state.error
 *    - User should be able to retry or return to lobby
 * 
 * 5. STATE PERSISTENCE BEHAVIOR:
 *    - Game state should be saved automatically during play
 *    - New game initialization should clear previous saved state
 *    - State should persist across browser sessions
 * 
 * 6. SCORING AND FEEDBACK:
 *    - Correct placements should increment score
 *    - Incorrect placements should show feedback message
 *    - Feedback should clear after a short delay
 *    - Score should persist throughout the game session
 * 
 * 7. TIMELINE INTEGRITY:
 *    - Timeline should maintain chronological order
 *    - Cards should be placed in correct historical sequence
 *    - Timeline should grow from left to right (earliest to latest)
 *    - No gaps should exist in timeline
 * 
 * TESTING APPROACH:
 *    - Tests focus on behavior, not implementation details
 *    - Use stable test utilities that won't break with code changes
 *    - Mock external dependencies (API) for consistent testing
 *    - Validate state structure and transitions, not internal logic
 *    - Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior

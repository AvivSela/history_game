- **Result**: Timeline and PlayerHand now always stack vertically

### Task 2: Timeline Component Optimization (45 minutes)

- **File**: `src/components/game/Timeline/Timeline.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Optimized card spacing for vertical layout
  - Adjusted insertion point positioning
  - Improved scroll controls for better touch targets
  - Enhanced responsive spacing across screen sizes

### Task 3: PlayerHand Component Optimization (60 minutes)

- **File**: `src/components/game/PlayerHand/PlayerHand.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Optimized card spread calculations for vertical layout
  - Reduced card overlap and angles for better visibility
  - Adjusted container spacing and padding
  - Improved responsive behavior

### Task 4: CSS Refinements (30 minutes)

- **Files**:
  - `src/pages/Game.css`
  - `src/components/game/Card/Card.css`
- **Changes**:
  - Optimized page padding for vertical layout
  - Adjusted card sizes and transforms for better vertical flow
  - Enhanced responsive breakpoints

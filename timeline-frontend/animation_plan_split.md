# Timeline Game Animation Implementation Plan (Split)

## Section 1: Ordered Task List

### Checklist

#### Phase 1: Core Duration Optimizations
- [x] Update animation timing and easing constants in `src/utils/animationUtils.js`
- [x] Update animation durations and keyframes in `src/index.css`
- [x] Update wrong placement animation sequence in `src/pages/Game.jsx`
- [x] Update and run animation tests *(animation tests pass; wrong placement test fails due to module mock issue, not animation logic)*

#### Phase 2: Performance Enhancements
- [ ] Implement animation queue system in `src/utils/animationQueue.js`
- [ ] Add GPU acceleration styles in `src/index.css`
- [ ] Update animation utilities to use the queue
- [ ] Update and run performance tests

#### Phase 3: Accessibility Improvements
- [ ] Add reduced motion support in `src/utils/accessibility.js`
- [ ] Add animation skip controls in `src/components/ui/AnimationControls.jsx`
- [ ] Update and run accessibility tests

#### Phase 4: Progressive Animation Loading
- [ ] Implement dynamic animation loading in `src/utils/progressiveAnimations.js`
- [ ] Add context-aware animation intensity in `src/utils/contextAwareAnimations.js`
- [ ] Update and run progressive loading/context tests

#### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Add and run unit, CSS, queue, accessibility, and integration tests

#### Phase 6: Integration and Deployment
- [ ] Update main components to use new animation system
- [ ] Add animation controls to UI
- [ ] Perform final end-to-end, performance, accessibility, and cross-browser testing

echo "======================="

# Check for common issues
echo "1. If you see 'waiting for status to be reported':"
echo "   - This usually means multiple workflows are running"
echo "   - Check if both 'Test Suite' and 'CI/CD Pipeline' are running"
echo "   - The workflows might be conflicting with each other"
echo ""

echo "2. If workflows are stuck:"
echo "   - Check the Actions tab in GitHub"
echo "   - Look for any failed steps or timeouts"
echo "   - Ensure all required dependencies are available"
echo ""

echo "3. If status checks are missing:"
echo "   - Check branch protection rules"
echo "   - Ensure workflows are properly configured"
echo "   - Verify that status checks are being reported"
echo ""

echo "4. Quick fixes to try:"
echo "   - Push a small change to trigger new workflow runs"
echo "   - Cancel any stuck workflow runs"
echo "   - Check if there are any dependency issues"
echo ""

echo "üìù Next Steps:"
echo "=============="
echo "1. Check the Actions tab: https://github.com/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/actions"
echo "2. Review workflow logs for any errors"
echo "3. If issues persist, try pushing a small commit to re-trigger workflows"
echo "4. Consider temporarily disabling conflicting workflows"

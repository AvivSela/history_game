# Timeline Game Layout Fix Plan

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Issue**: Timeline and user deck are displayed side by side on larger screens (lg breakpoint and above), but the user wants them to always be stacked vertically with the timeline on top and the user hand below, regardless of screen size.

**Current Behavior**:
- Mobile/Tablet (< 1024px): ✅ Timeline on top, PlayerHand below (vertical)
- Desktop (≥ 1024px): ❌ Timeline and PlayerHand side by side (horizontal)

**Desired Behavior**: ✅ Timeline on top, PlayerHand below (vertical) on ALL screen sizes

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
**File**: `timeline-frontend/src/components/core/GameBoard/GameBoard.jsx`
**Line**: 84
**Current Code**: `className="flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8"`
**Problem**: The `lg:flex-row` class switches to horizontal layout on screens ≥1024px

### Affected Components
1. **GameBoard** (`src/components/core/GameBoard/GameBoard.jsx`) - Main layout container
2. **Timeline** (`src/components/game/Timeline/Timeline.jsx`) - Timeline component  
3. **PlayerHand** (`src/components/game/PlayerHand/PlayerHand.jsx`) - Player's card hand
4. **CSS Files**:
   - `src/pages/Game.css` - Game page styles
   - `src/components/game/Timeline/Timeline.css` - Timeline specific styles
   - `src/components/game/Card/Card.css` - Card styles

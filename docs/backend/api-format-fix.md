# API Response Format Fix

## Problem Description

**Bug**: API Response Format Change Causes Frontend Failures

The API response format for event data had changed from camelCase to snake_case (e.g., `dateOccurred` was `date_occurred`). This breaking change occurred because the backend was directly returning database column names, which are in snake_case, instead of transforming them to the camelCase format expected by the frontend.

### Impact
- Frontend components expecting `dateOccurred` would fail when receiving `date_occurred`
- Game logic functions using `dateOccurred` would break
- Timeline components would not display dates correctly
- All frontend tests expecting camelCase format would fail

## Root Cause

The database schema uses snake_case column names (e.g., `date_occurred`, `created_at`, `updated_at`), but the frontend expects camelCase property names (e.g., `dateOccurred`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`). The backend was returning raw database results without transformation.

## Solution

### 1. Created Data Transformation Utility

**File**: `timeline-backend/utils/dataTransform.js`

```javascript
/**
 * Convert snake_case string to camelCase
 */
function snakeToCamel(str) {
  return str.replace(/_([a-z])/g, (match, letter) => letter.toUpperCase());
}

/**
 * Transform object keys from snake_case to camelCase
 */
function transformObjectKeys(obj) {
  // Recursively transform object keys
  // Handles nested objects and arrays
}

/**
 * Transform card data from database format to frontend format
 */
function transformCardData(data) {
  return transformObjectKeys(data);
}
```

### 2. Updated Database Utilities

**File**: `timeline-backend/utils/database.js`

Modified all functions that return card data to use the transformation:

- `getAllCards()` - Now returns camelCase format
- `getRandomCards()` - Now returns camelCase format  
- `getCardById()` - Now returns camelCase format
- `getCardsByCategory()` - Now returns camelCase format

### 3. Updated Tests

**Files**: 
- `timeline-backend/__tests__/api.test.js`
- `timeline-backend/__tests__/database.test.js`

Updated test expectations from `date_occurred` to `dateOccurred` to match the new camelCase format.

## Verification

### Before Fix
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "World War II ends",
  "date_occurred": "1945-09-02",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### After Fix
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "World War II ends", 
  "dateOccurred": "1945-09-02",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Testing

- ✅ All backend tests pass
- ✅ API endpoints return camelCase format
- ✅ Database utilities transform data correctly
- ✅ Frontend will receive expected format

## Files Modified

1. **New File**: `timeline-backend/utils/dataTransform.js` - Data transformation utilities
2. **Modified**: `timeline-backend/utils/database.js` - Added transformation to all card retrieval functions
3. **Modified**: `timeline-backend/__tests__/api.test.js` - Updated test expectations
4. **Modified**: `timeline-backend/__tests__/database.test.js` - Updated test expectations
5. **New File**: `timeline-backend/__tests__/dataTransform.test.js` - Tests for transformation utilities

## Benefits

1. **Frontend Compatibility**: Frontend components will work without modification
2. **Consistent API**: All endpoints now return consistent camelCase format
3. **Maintainable**: Clear separation between database and API formats
4. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage for transformation logic
5. **Extensible**: Transformation utility can be reused for other data types

## Additional Bug Fix: Date Object Handling

### Problem
During testing, it was discovered that the data transformation utility was not handling Date objects correctly. The database returns Date objects for date fields, but the transformation function was treating them as regular objects and trying to transform their keys, resulting in empty objects `{}`.

### Solution
Updated the `transformObjectKeys` function to properly handle Date objects:

```javascript
function transformObjectKeys(obj) {
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== 'object') {
    return obj;
  }

  // Handle Date objects - return them as-is
  if (obj instanceof Date) {
    return obj;
  }

  // ... rest of the function
}
```

### Test Fix
Also fixed the date validation test in `database.test.js`:

**Before (flawed):**
```javascript
expect(new Date(card.date_occurred)).not.toBeInstanceOf(Error);
```

**After (correct):**
```javascript
const date = new Date(card.dateOccurred);
expect(isNaN(date.getTime())).toBe(false);
expect(date instanceof Date).toBe(true);
```

The original test was flawed because:
1. It checked `card.date_occurred` (snake_case) instead of `card.dateOccurred` (camelCase)
2. `new Date()` never returns an Error object; it returns an "Invalid Date" object for invalid inputs
3. The correct way to validate dates is to check if `getTime()` returns a valid number

## Future Considerations

- The transformation utility can be extended to handle other data types
- Consider adding validation to ensure all required fields are present
- Monitor performance impact of transformation on large datasets
- Consider caching transformed data for frequently accessed records

# Technical Debt Management Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. View Current Technical Debt
```bash
# View the markdown file directly
cat TECHNICAL_DEBT.md
```

### 2. Add New Debt Item
```bash
# Edit TECHNICAL_DEBT.md directly
# Add a new entry following the existing format
```

### 3. Update Debt Status
```bash
# Edit TECHNICAL_DEBT.md directly
# Update the status field for the relevant item
```

### 4. Generate Report
```bash
# Review TECHNICAL_DEBT.md manually
# Use the summary section at the top of the file
```

## Debt Categories

### ðŸ”´ High Priority (Critical)
- **When to use**: Blocks new features, causes bugs, security issues
- **Action**: Address immediately
- **Examples**: 
  - Database integration missing
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Performance issues blocking features

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority (Important)
- **When to use**: Slows development, poor user experience
- **Action**: Address within 2-4 weeks
- **Examples**:
  - Code organization issues
  - Missing documentation
  - Performance optimizations

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- **When to use**: Code quality, maintainability improvements
- **Action**: Address when convenient
- **Examples**:
  - Code formatting
  - Minor refactoring
  - Documentation updates

## Status Options

- **Open**: Not yet started
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Review**: Ready for code review
- **Resolved**: Completed and merged
- **Deferred**: Postponed to future sprint

## Best Practices

### When to Add Technical Debt
1. **During code reviews** - Identify issues that need addressing
2. **After feature completion** - Note areas that could be improved
3. **During bug fixes** - Document underlying issues
4. **Performance audits** - Note optimization opportunities
5. **Security reviews** - Document vulnerabilities

### How to Prioritize
1. **Impact vs Effort Matrix**:
   - High Impact, Low Effort â†’ Do First
   - High Impact, High Effort â†’ Plan Carefully
   - Low Impact, Low Effort â†’ Do When Convenient
   - Low Impact, High Effort â†’ Avoid

2. **Consider Dependencies**:
   - Some debt blocks other improvements
   - Address blocking debt first

3. **User Impact**:
   - Prioritize debt that affects users
   - Internal debt can wait longer

### Refactoring Guidelines
1. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b refactor/TECHNICAL_DEBT_ID`
2. **Write tests first**: Ensure existing functionality is covered
3. **Make small changes**: Incremental improvements are safer
4. **Test frequently**: Run tests after each change
5. **Document changes**: Update this file and relevant docs
6. **Get review**: Have changes reviewed by team members

## Common Patterns

### Frontend Debt
- **Component organization**: Nested directories, mixed concerns
- **State management**: Multiple state management approaches
- **Performance**: Large bundles, slow renders
- **Testing**: Inconsistent test patterns
- **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

### Backend Debt
- **Database**: Hardcoded data, missing migrations
- **API design**: Inconsistent endpoints, poor error handling
- **Security**: Missing validation, exposed sensitive data
- **Performance**: N+1 queries, missing caching
- **Monitoring**: No logging, missing metrics

### Infrastructure Debt
- **Deployment**: Manual processes, no CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: No alerts, missing dashboards
- **Security**: No backups, missing SSL
- **Scalability**: No load balancing, single points of failure

## Metrics to Track

### Monthly Metrics
- Total debt items
- New debt added
- Debt resolved
- Net change
- Resolution rate

### Priority Distribution
- High priority items
- Medium priority items
- Low priority items
- Effort distribution

### Category Breakdown
- Frontend debt
- Backend debt
- Infrastructure debt
- Cross-cutting concerns

## Tools Integration

### ESLint Rules
Add these rules to catch common issues:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "complexity": ["error", 10],
    "max-lines-per-function": ["error", 50],
    "max-params": ["error", 4],
    "no-duplicate-imports": "error",
    "prefer-const": "error"
  }
}
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
Ensure code quality before commits:
```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  }
}
```

### Bundle Analysis
Monitor bundle size:
```bash
yarn build --analyze
```

## Team Workflow

### Sprint Planning
1. Review current technical debt
2. Prioritize items for the sprint
3. Estimate effort for selected items
4. Assign to team members

### Daily Standup
1. Mention any new debt discovered
2. Update status of in-progress debt
3. Blockers related to technical debt

### Sprint Review
1. Review resolved debt items
2. Update metrics
3. Plan debt reduction for next sprint

### Retrospective
1. What debt was created this sprint?
2. What debt was resolved?
3. How can we prevent debt accumulation?

*Remember: Technical debt is not inherently bad, but it should be managed intentionally and paid down regularly.*

# New Backend Service - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Prisma ORM
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS (ECS Fargate, RDS, ALB)
- **API Style**: RESTful with OpenAPI documentation

### Architecture Highlights
- **Microservices-ready**: Designed for future scaling
- **Database-first**: Robust data model with proper relationships
- **Security-focused**: JWT auth, API keys, input validation
- **Monitoring-ready**: Health checks, logging, metrics

## üìä Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
1. **cards** - Historical events with metadata
2. **categories** - Card categories with styling
3. **game_sessions** - Game state and progression
4. **game_moves** - Individual player actions
5. **player_statistics** - User performance tracking

### Key Features
- **UUID-based sessions** for scalability
- **JSONB metadata** for flexible card data
- **Proper indexing** for performance
- **Audit trails** with timestamps

## üîå API Endpoints Summary

### Card Management
- `GET /cards` - List cards with filtering
- `GET /cards/random` - Get random cards for games
- `POST /cards` - Create new cards (admin)
- `PUT /cards/:id` - Update cards (admin)
- `DELETE /cards/:id` - Delete cards (admin)

### Game Management
- `POST /game-sessions` - Start new game
- `POST /game-sessions/:id/moves` - Record player moves
- `PUT /game-sessions/:id/end` - End game session

### Statistics
- `GET /statistics/player/:id` - Player performance
- `GET /statistics/leaderboard` - Global rankings

## üöÄ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Set up Node.js project with Express
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL with Prisma
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Set up Docker containerization
- [ ] Create initial API endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Implement card management system
- [ ] Build game session management
- [ ] Add statistics and leaderboards
- [ ] Implement authentication system
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests

### Phase 3: Production Ready (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Set up AWS infrastructure
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement monitoring and logging
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening

### Phase 4: Migration (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Data migration from current backend
- [ ] Frontend integration testing
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Post-launch monitoring

## üîß Development Setup Commands

```bash
# Initial setup
git clone <repository>
cd timeline-game-project
yarn install

# Database setup
docker-compose up db -d
yarn db:migrate
yarn db:seed

# Development
yarn dev

# Testing
yarn test
yarn test:integration

# Production build
yarn build
docker build -t timeline-api .
```

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Review the design document** and provide feedback
2. **Set up development environment** with Docker
3. **Create initial project structure** following the design
4. **Implement basic health check endpoint**

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Database schema implementation** with Prisma
2. **Core API endpoints** for card management
3. **Basic authentication** system
4. **Integration tests** for all endpoints

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **AWS infrastructure** setup with Terraform
2. **CI/CD pipeline** implementation
3. **Performance testing** and optimization
4. **Security audit** and hardening

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Technical Goals
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Uptime**: > 99.9% availability
- **Test Coverage**: > 90% for all endpoints
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities

### Business Goals
- **Seamless Migration**: No downtime during transition
- **Enhanced Features**: Better card management capabilities
- **Future Ready**: Architecture supports multiplayer expansion
- **Scalable**: Handles growth from low to high traffic

## üîç Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **API Compatibility**: Maintain existing endpoint structure
- **Deployment Issues**: Comprehensive testing and rollback plans

### Business Risks
- **Data Migration**: Backup strategies and validation
- **User Experience**: Gradual rollout with feature flags
- **Downtime**: Blue-green deployment strategy

## üìû Support & Resources

### Documentation
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger at `/api/docs`
- **Database Schema**: Prisma schema files
- **Deployment Guide**: Terraform and Docker documentation

### Tools & Services
- **Development**: Docker Compose for local setup
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for AWS metrics
- **Logging**: Winston for structured logging

# Behavior Test Conversion Plan

## Overview
This document outlines 20 existing tests that should be converted from implementation-focused tests to behavior-driven tests. Each test focuses on user behavior, business logic, and user experience rather than implementation details.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Behavior Test Structure
Each behavior test should follow this structure:

```javascript
describe('As a player', () => {
  it('I can select a card from my hand', () => {
    // Given: I have cards in my hand
    // When: I click on a card
    // Then: The card becomes selected
  });
});
```

### Key Principles
1. **Focus on User Behavior:** Test what the user does and experiences
2. **Business Value:** Ensure tests verify features that matter to users
3. **User Stories:** Frame tests around user goals and needs
4. **Given/When/Then:** Use clear behavior-driven language
5. **End-to-End:** Test complete user workflows when possible

### Benefits of Conversion
- **More Maintainable:** Less likely to break with implementation changes
- **Clearer Intent:** Tests clearly communicate what behavior is expected
- **User-Focused:** Ensures we're building features users actually need
- **Better Documentation:** Tests serve as living documentation of user behavior

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize tests based on user impact and business value
2. Convert tests one category at a time
3. Update test descriptions to use behavior-driven language
4. Ensure all user stories are covered by behavior tests
5. Remove or refactor implementation-focused tests that don't add value

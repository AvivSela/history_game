Here are high-value behavior tests you can add to improve your coverage rate, based on your coverage report and codebase:
1. GameStatus Component
Test that the correct overlay appears for each game state (won, paused, etc).
Test that the correct callback is called when clicking "Play Again", "Resume Game", or "Home".
Test that feedback toasts display the right message, points, and attempt number.
Test that overlays and toasts disappear when not relevant.
2. TurnIndicator Component
Test that the correct message and styling appear for both player and AI turns.
Test that the component is accessible (e.g., correct roles, readable text).
3. PlayerHand Component
Test that all cards in the hand render with correct info.
Test that clicking a card selects/deselects it and calls the callback.
Test that the progress bar updates as cards are played.
Test that the victory message appears when the hand is empty.
Test that the correct UI appears for player vs. AI turn.
4. Home Page
Test that the main title, description, and all feature steps render.
Test that navigation links/buttons work and have correct hrefs.
Test that demo cards and feature/stat cards render with correct content.
5. useSettings Hook
Test that updating a setting triggers validation and updates state.
Test that restoring settings from backup works and handles errors.
Test that change/error/validation callbacks are called appropriately.
Test that the diff and unsaved changes utilities work as expected.
6. Settings Page
Test that changing a setting updates the UI and triggers save status.
Test that validation errors are shown when invalid input is provided.
Test that the reset button resets all settings and shows confirmation.
7. Game Flow (Integration)
Test a full game flow: initialize, select card, place card, win, restart.
Test that pausing and resuming works and updates the UI.
Test that error states (e.g., API failure) show the error screen and allow retry.
